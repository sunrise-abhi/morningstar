## Key Decisions Made

### Technology Stack
- **Framework**: Next.js 14+ with App Router
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
- **Auth**: NextAuth.js v5 (Auth.js)
- **UI**: ShadCN UI + TailwindCSS
- **AI**: OpenAI GPT-4
- **Storage**: Vercel Blob for images/audio
- **Hosting**: Vercel

### Architecture Decisions
1. **Server Components First**: Maximize use of React Server Components
2. **Morning Pages Gate**: Implemented at middleware level for performance
3. **AI Analysis**: Batch processing via cron jobs to reduce costs
4. **File Storage**: Vercel Blob for simplicity (can migrate to S3 later)
5. **Voice Input**: Web Speech API (browser-native) for voice-to-text
6. **Notifications**: Web Push API with optional email fallback

### Database Design
- Soft deletes for most entities (via `archivedAt` fields)
- One morning page per user per day (unique constraint)
- One habit log per habit per day (unique constraint)
- Primary goal flag on Goal model (only one active)
- Separate tables for AI analysis results

---

## Known Issues & Considerations

### Current Issues
- None (project not yet started)

### Technical Debt
- None yet

### Open Questions
1. **Email Provider**: Which email service for magic links? (SendGrid, Resend, AWS SES)
2. **Database Hosting**: Vercel Postgres vs Supabase vs Railway?
3. **OpenAI Budget**: What monthly budget for AI analysis?
4. **Domain Name**: Has domain been registered?
5. **Team Access**: Who needs access to production?

---

## Dependencies & Blockers

### External Dependencies
- [ ] PostgreSQL database provisioned
- [ ] OpenAI API key obtained
- [ ] Email service configured (for magic links)
- [ ] Vercel account set up
- [ ] Domain name (if custom domain desired)

### Blockers
- None currently

---

## Recent Accomplishments
- ✅ Complete system architecture designed
- ✅ Database schema finalized with all relationships
- ✅ Technical specifications documented
- ✅ Comprehensive task breakdown created (17 phases)
- ✅ Development timeline estimated

## Upcoming Milestones

### Next 2 Weeks
1. Complete Phase 0: Project Setup
2. Complete Phase 1: Authentication
3. Complete Phase 2: Database Migrations
4. Begin Phase 4: Morning Pages

### Next 4 Weeks (Month 1)
1. Core features implemented (Morning Pages, Goal, Journal)
2. AI analysis integrated
3. Dashboard functional
4. Basic habit tracking working

### Next 8 Weeks (Month 2)
1. All features complete
2. Polish and UX refinement done
3. Testing completed
4. Deployed to production
5. Team using the app daily

## Team & Resources

### Team Members
- Abhishek (Primary Developer)
- Sunrise Systems Team (Users & Testers)

### Time Allocation
- **Estimated Total**: 155-195 hours
- **Timeline**: 4-5 weeks for single developer
- **Current Sprint**: Planning (Week 0)

---

## Risks & Mitigation

### High-Priority Risks
1. **OpenAI API Costs**: Batch processing and caching to minimize
2. **Scope Creep**: Stick to defined phases, park nice-to-haves
3. **Time Estimates**: Built in 20% buffer on estimates

### Medium-Priority Risks
1. **Web Speech API Browser Support**: Fallback to text-only for unsupported browsers
2. **File Storage Costs**: Monitor usage, implement size limits
3. **Database Performance**: Proper indexing defined upfront

---

## Notes

### Design Philosophy
- **Minimalist**: Clean, distraction-free interfaces
- **Calming**: Gentle colors, smooth animations
- **Inviting**: Prompts feel like invitations, not demands
- **Goal-Centric**: Primary goal woven throughout experience
- **Reflective**: Focus on insights over metrics

### Target Users
- Primary: Abhishek and Sunrise Systems team
- Future: Small teams and individual users seeking intentional productivity
