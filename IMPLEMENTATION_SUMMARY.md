6. **Notifications**: Database ready but push notification system not implemented

## 🎯 Next Steps (Priority Order)

### High Priority (Must Have)
1. **Configure Email Provider** (5 min) - Required for authentication
2. **Test User Flows** (30 min) - Sign up, morning pages, journal, habits
3. **Add OpenAI Key** (5 min) - Optional but enables AI features
4. **Enhanced Morning Pages Gate** (2 hours) - Proper middleware blocking

### Medium Priority (Should Have)
5. **Moodboard Image Upload** (3 hours) - Vercel Blob integration
6. **Breathwork Animation** (4 hours) - Animated breathing timer
7. **Journal Entry Detail Page** (2 hours) - View entry with AI insights
8. **Habit Calendar Heatmap** (3 hours) - Visual progress tracking

### Nice to Have (Could Have)
9. **Web Push Notifications** (4 hours) - Gentle reminders
10. **Dark Mode** (2 hours) - Theme toggle
11. **Data Export** (2 hours) - PDF/JSON export
12. **Search Functionality** (3 hours) - Search journal entries
13. **Advanced Charts** (4 hours) - Trend visualizations
